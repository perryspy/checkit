1. `npm install`
  * installs all needed npm modules, bower packages, and does an initial build of our JS and CSS files.
2. `mongod`
  * starts the local database
3. `gulp watch`
  * since our js files are minified to a single file, this ensures your updates make it to the site
4. `nodemon server.js`
  * allows us to make changes on the server, without restarting it every time.
